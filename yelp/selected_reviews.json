Sorry to ruin the mystery of the name. The building itself is a spectacle-- a brightly colored fusion of indoors and outdoors with a few different bars, games like the beanbag toss and televised sporting events in every direction, music blaring, a room dedicated to Elvis, and more Chuck Norris jokes than you can count plastered across the walls along with a bevy of posters advertising drink specials. A line of blue footprints painted across the concrete floor leads to the men's room, dollar signs to the ATM... genius stuff, really. It wouldn't have been at all out of place were they to have tried selling surfing monkey statues or trotting out a donkey painted like a zebra for an extra special photo opportunity.\n\nRumor had it that Dos Gringos had a killer Sunday brunch buffet and Bloody Mary bar, so we showed up at 10:30 AM to find... that they hadn't opened yet. A place that offers brunch but has the balls to wait until after 11 is okay in my book. Ten bucks gets you all-you-can-eat eggs, bacon, chile verde, beans, and a bunch of other stuff to tickle your fancy. There's nothing like sitting out in the sun, feeding a hangover and resuscitating last night's buzz before the clock strikes noon, and it sure beats sitting in traffic when that monstrosity of a church up the street unleashes some Old Testament fury on Alma School Road. Dos Gringos probably gets spring break wild on Friday night, but on Sunday morning, this place was just as tranquil as the doctor ordered.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RqbSeoeqXTwts5pfhw7nJg"}

I'm from Jersey, everybody in my family raves about Jersey Mikes and they are all in Jersey.  First off,  I ordered the Italian sub that comes with the works (5 different meats) and is supposed to come with provolone.  Got home to Buckeye to learn there was no provolone on my sandwich.  That throws the taste of an Italian sub off, period.  My second disappointment was the meat.  The franchise contracts out to a provisioner to make all their cold cuts under the Jersey Mike's label, but the meat does not have the flavor of New Jersey's finest deli meats, Thumann's. Boar's Head doesn't come in close to Thumann's but I'll take Boar's Head when nothing else is available. Third place goes to Dietz and Watson.  If Peter Cancro, the CEO of Mike's really cares, he'll get his meat elsewhere. \n\nThe staff was very friendly, the restaurant was clean, there were blown up photos of the Pt. Pleasant side of the Manasquan Inlet and Jenk's pier with surfers heading out, a nice touch of back home, but that's the best I can say.  The staff was so personable I don't regret leaving them a tip even though they forgot my cheese.

We then had a different teacher every couple of weeks for the first half of the year. When we finally got a permanent teacher, the damage was done. The kids had no connection or respect for any teacher who walked in the door anymore.\n  The year I graduated, there were 3000 students and over 1000 in my graduating class. We often had 40+ kids in one classroom. \nMan, I hated this school. When I first started on the Bell Rd Campus, we referred to it as PV Prison because of the tall, iron, spiked gates and security in golf carts patrolling the campus for potential escapees. I remember, before they briefly closed the campus for renovations, a girl falling through the auditorium wall, and pieces of the ceiling falling on peoples heads before they condemned it. After 2 years at this location, they suddenly closed the campus and opened the new campus on Union Hills, the campus that was to become North Canyon.\n They built the new campus with the intention of having both schools open, but as more and more buildings kept falling apart, they decided to shut down PV and re-open it under the same name on the new campus. \n They spent a shit-ton fuck load of money on a super high-tech theater, in return for letting it be used for official Gov't events,  that no one new how to use. This was one of the best things about it. I was one of the few people who could run the sound and lights and got out of class frequently because of it. \n I remember making a video with Casey about an art show the school was having and not being allowed to air it on the morning video announcements because we used the phrase \"come out of the closet\" and they thought the phrase might be offensive. Then, that same week, the football team had a video where they all pretended to be gay, talking with lisps and flailing limp wrists. When I went to the office to ask what the fuck, they told me that football players didn't need approval for anything they did. I remember my friend being expelled for missing too much school due to chicken pox and a mother not well enough to call her in. I, of course, seemed invisible to the system. I ditched class often, and it never showed on my record at all. I remember when Miss Lee dressed as a hard rocker with tattoo's for halloween and the administrators making her change it because the costume was a bad influence. I remember my friends boyfriend being suspended because they searched his car for drugs (on an anonymous tip) and found a box cutter in his trunk he used for work which he kept in his trunk because he went to work straight from school.  I remember testing out of highschool classes before freshman year, yet being subjected to 4 years of bullshit. I am pretty sure it was PVUSD that was the inspiration for the movie \"Pump Up the Volume\", which was filmed in the general area.\n  When I quit the softball team, the coach/school councilor kept sending people to pull me out of class to try to talk me into playing again. When we took pictures for the badminton team, we didn't have enough uniforms for the entire team. \n I felt like I was in some prison or some high security mental facility. In fact, when my mom visited the new campus, she was horrified there were no windows and they used the drab, grey/blue colors they use in mental hospitals she had worked in to keep the patients calm. I never had a chemistry class. My two history classes consisted of a teacher who spent one entire year talking about Shakespear, and another who said that \"The slaves did not have it so bad\".  My Biology book was so old, it had my friends mothers name in it from 20 years earlier, AND same friends mother warned me against my Biology teacher, Mr. H__. \"If he ever tells you to stay after class by yourself.. DON'T.\"  \n \nThe Good Things I Remember -\n Mrs. Toal [sp?], a very good, and supportive, English teacher. Miss Lee, the best photography/video teacher ever and always had the best Halloween costumes. Hanging out at lunch under a tree with the boy we called Rico Suave who said he lived in a box and would tell stories about the Horny Lady. Sneaking off campus to go to Barrows Pizza. My friends  wearing cut out Trojan condom boxes pinned to their shirt at the forced \"spirit assemblies\" and chanting our own spirit chant of \"Fuck you all we hope you die, that's the Trojan battle cry\".\n\n Time has a way of blurring the past, and making it less icky. Yet, my sister is a teacher at North Canyon, and a few years back I went and visited her on campus. The second I stepped into the main building, I felt sick to my stomach. Literally. \n I hear they have made improvements since I graduated, and I hope so. I don't want my niece and nephew forced to survive another drone factory.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jNS0oWMju3PyOHkMDcv02A"}

Roy was a major judge in the competition.\n\nThe loss of my job nearly four years ago caused a major shift in priorities for me, as in no more trips to Hawaii anytime soon. Ditto for dining on haute cuisine. \n\nSomehow I stumbled onto the website for Roy's and learned about the Aloha menu.  With a five dollar price ceiling for drinks and food, I reckoned I could once again sample food that was the culinary equivalent of transcendence without feeling guilty about the expenditure afterwards.\nSo, I cajoled my meat and potatoes Midwestern beau into taking me to Roy's for an early light meal and cocktails.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in the door, everything was perfect and professional- very professional. I should know, once upon a time I made my living in haute cuisine restaurants. I've always said it's easy to find great food for a commensurate price, the trick is getting great food without a hefty pricetag. Aloha hour at Roy's affords a person such as myself the opportunity to experience innovative cuisine and cocktails without forfeiting a necessity of life such as electricity for a month.\n\nGetting back to the staff, we were greeted and treated as if we had arrived in a limo instead of a Tundra. Once seated in the bar for Aloha hour we were not subjected to thinly veiled contempt from the server who realized that the tab was not going to merit the same gratuity as a several course meal.  The hostess, our server, and the manager on duty were  all extremely cordial, polite and provided seamless service and even better food.  \n\nThe original hawaiian martini I ordered was prepared with top shelf liquors, not cheap substitutes to reflect the reduced price.\n\nWe loved the salt and pepper calamari, Waygu sliders, potstickers, and the sushi rolls with a spin.  For a fraction of the price of the average degustation menu we sampled the gamut of appetizers and several drinks- well, I had several drinks, not the driver.  As for ambiance, we were seated at a banquette adjacent to a very large marine fish aquarium.  The atmosphere was subdued, urbane, comfortable and the staff was attentive, accommodating, and knowledgeable. Since we were on a date at the time, the server offered to take our photo. It was presented to us in a paper frame shortly afterward.

After four exceptional visits, I decided it was time to show some love. The food is a knockout, the service is always friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere is pitch-perfect. I always feel like I'm at a great dinner party in the fabulous home of a great local chef. Let's talk food:\n1. Cheese Curds - Basically the best fried things ever. At $5, just get them and laugh at the idiots eating something by the same name at Culver's.\n2. Brussel Sprouts - I can't remember the exact description, but they were crazy good. My boyfriend and I actually had to bargain for the last spoonful.\n3. Stuffed Medjool Dates - That perfect melding of sweet/rich/spicy/salty. I wanted more, but I maintained my composure because the entree arrived as we ran out.\n4. Pork Tenderloin - This was perfection. Tender/perfectlycooked/juicy/flavorful/gorgeous grilled tenderloin. I thought I'd had great pork, but I was sorely mistaken. The sweetness from the date butter was just unbelievable. I've had my share of pork with some sort of apple concoction. That's all fine and good, but nothing has ever come close to this. I can't wait to go back to have this dish again.\n5. Chicken & Waffles - The ultra-crunchy breading on the most perfectly cooked piece of chicken ever. As a boy from Kentucky, I can't say that this was the best fried chicken of my life, but it absolutely ranked among the greats. (Actually, I might give the crown to Arrogant Butcher on their fried chicken night). The white cheddar waffle is unlike anything I've had. Crazy addictive and strange. Highly recommended\n6. Ribs Special - So here is where I felt that I could have passed. They were very good ribs, but they weren't in the realm of Earth-shattering. Although, I am unfairly comparing them to the best joints in Memphis.\n7. Bread Pudding - silent weeping with one hand raised to the heavens. Praise.\n8. Beet Chip Spinach Salad - What fun! Just loved the balance flavors and textures. Great salad to get for the table and share.\n\nThe thing about Tuck Shop is that they take a food that you think you know, and they make it better than you thought it could ever be.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rQ4z0EStSZE4acgkne6Hmg"}

What this means is that for regular coach passengers it takes more than a half hour to get thru the damn security screening checkpoint so Good Luck if you're trying to catch a flight in another terminal.\n\n  Also, hardly any screens that show flight/gate information. If it's not on your boarding pass or if your boarding pass gate # is wrong, good luck finding what gate you're supposed to be on.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g"}

They even offer no filter cigarettes. The prices for the burgers range from $7.29 -$12.95.  I had a single bypass burger and flatliner fries.

The fries arrived first then when the burger arrives the nurse points you toward the toppings bar where you can add tomatoes, pickles, onion, jalape\u00f1os, ketchup and mustard to your burger.

We were so glad that China King satisfied our craving for dim sum on our vacation and was reasonably priced.\n\nPerhaps because it wasn't the weekend, but they didn't push around the dim sum carts instead leaving them on the side of the kitchen. I would recommend picking up one of the dim sum menus from the front desk to peruse the selection because they don't provide a menu on the table. But basically they have all the regulars and they are solid choices. They gave us a complimentary plate of Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce as soon as you sit down. They were very tender and we cleaned the entire plate. \n\nBeing an ABC California girl, I judge the quality of dim sum on 2 items: the steamed shrimp dumpling (har gow) and the custard tart (don tot). At China King both items were tasty and satisfactory but not exceptional. However, when you live in a town where there isn't any dim sum (like ABQ) then you will take what you can get when you are traveling. Additionally, we had the following items which I would also categorize as acceptable/satisfactory but not exceptional: steamed shrimp & beef noodle rolls, spareribs, tripe, sparerib congee, baked custard buns (I prefer the steamed ones), and chicken feet. We ordered the taro puffs and fried long donuts wrapped in rice paper from the kitchen but they took too long to make them and we were full at that point so we canceled our order for those.\n\nI have no hesitation recommending China King for dim sum to my fellow Yelpers.

It is huge with amenities for every kind of person: water basketball, water volleyball, slide or you can relax in wading pools, and literally, every day of our vacation during the Labor Day weekend, as packed as the pool was, we always got a lounge chair and could even find a corner of a pool to ourselves. The second best thing about the hotel is the size of the rooms! A regular room is HUGE and we had a wonderful view of the lake that surrounds the hotel. The third best thing about the hotel is their nightly live entertainment. I love that you don't even need to leave the hotel if you don't want to. One night they had a spanish band and the next night they had jazz, and the next they had a Native American hoop dancer. All of the staff at the resort were extremely friendly and helpful. This place is great for adults only or for families! We will definitely be staying here again on our next trip to Arizona.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xtX2qS64zP2NRPV_7NNqHw"}

Three of us asked for no bacon on our shrimp salad, but all three were incorrect. The waitress took two of them back and left us with our soup, which I didn't want to start eating because she hadn't yet brought the hot sauce (they only have Tobasco, which in Arizona is pretty stupid) I had requested 10 minutes earlier. Another 10 minutes later she brought the rest of the salads, by which time the others at our table had finished their first rounds. We all had beverages (one cold tea, 2 waters, and 2 coffees) which would have free refills but we had to keep asking for refills instead of being offered. The waitress forgot the lemon that my sister-in-law had requested. The waitress once cleared 4 of our plates but went and served another table before clearing the last of ours ten minutes later.

So, keep that in mind with this review.  First and foremost, the food was excellent.  My spinach ravioli with garlic creme sauce was delightful.  It was very light on the cream and topped with sauteed spinach.  Highly recommended.  My husband's pasta dish was light and tasty but the butter sauce lacked a little flavor.  However, the smoked chicken and bowtie pasta were cooked to perfection.  The sourdough bread and flavored butter were also a nice touch.\n\nThe atmosphere is cool and the prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of the food.  We have spent this much at crappy burger joints.  The bar is good looking and we enjoyed the openness of the restaurant.  Service was decent but it was almost as though we were in at an off time because our table was being covered by three or four different waiters/managers.  That did not really work for me.  I can imagine that dinner at Bloom is spectacular and I look forward to giving that a whirl.", "type": "review", "business_id": "i2gLXa-MSAS-9oU8K_rnYQ"}

I had hair down to the crack in my rear. I wore black jeans, a flannel shirt over a metal band t-shirt, and  the typical denim jacket covered in patches saluting heavy metal bands like Iron Maiden, Metallica, Slayer, Skid Row, and of course... Alice Cooper. I was cool.\n\nCooper's Town is part Hard Rock Cafe and part ESPN Zone. They have a small amount of rock memorabilia, signed guitars and such, hanging on the walls. They have a large amount of sports memorabilia and over 15 television screens to watch currently happening games, games of the past, and highlights from different sporting events around the country. A mix of music, surprisingly mostly not metal, plays overhead. \n\nThe servers all sport black t-shirts with a white image of Alice Cooper's eyes with his eyeliner reminiscent of The Crow. They are also all wearing said eyeliner. It looked a bit silly on many of them, but I do have to give them points for wearing it proudly and not seeming too embarrassed about it. I have to admit that I found the decor of the bar and the wear of the staff amusing at least. I give them a star for that.\n\nOur server was reasonably chipper. She paid a reasonable amount of attention to us for most of our time there, but ignored us for quite a while once the food came then a bit longer once we were done. \n\nThe food was decent, but barely decent. My fiance got the a salad with Thai-inspired chicken and peanut sauce. She said the peanut sauce was good and the chicken okay, but the salad was all iceberg lettuce. Iceberg? Really? Only iceberg? Keep in mind that her and I eat out a lot. It's only at the small hole-in-the-wall greasy spoon that we would ever expect to get a lot of iceberg, much less ONLY iceberg in a salad. \"That's the way we do a lot of our salads,\" we were told by the server. My burger, which was supposed to be cooked medium, came very well done. It was akin to chewing a meat-flavored hockey puck. \n\nThe only good point, foodwise, was the dessert. We got a sort of cinnamony apple cobbler with vanilla ice cream. It was good. It was pretty darn good. I give them a star for that.\n\nWhen we got the bill, we saw that we were not charged for the mostly iceberg salad. We didn't really expect to not have to pay for it, but were pleased indeed that we didn't. I give them a star for that.\n\nOverall, the food and the service were pretty lacking. On the upside, if you're a metalhead or metalhead in recovery, there is a good chance that you'll spot Alice himself if you visit during the winter, and you can purchase overpriced Alice Cooper t-shirts and other stuff the whole year around.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oCA2OZcd_Jo_ggVmUx3WVw"}

Italian posters have taken over the store and it's kept dark. They seemed to have a vast array of authentic Italian foods for cooking at home.

The salami with the cheese they used plus the condiments gave the sub a nice little kick. Everything tasted quite fresh. The tomatoes were smaller and shiny, bright red. The prices are great. What I could tell a sub runs 2.50- 4.00. Well worth it for its size. They also have the option of getting a side with your sub.

Mint Thai brings the culture, tastes, and ingredients of Thailand right to our community.  The most important part of a Thai meal, especially red curry is that it is authentic. There are four main reasons why Mint Thai has the most authentic red curry. \nIt can almost be considered as common sense, but it is crucial to the red curry that the ingredients are fresh and imported from Thailand. When you are cooking other types of food, this may not seem as important but with red curry there are a lot of herbs and other ingredients that simply cannot be produced correctly here in America. If they do make it here, it will not be the right flavor to give you the true Thai taste. The red curry paste is specific to Thailand. The spices used in the Thai red curry paste are not the same as other places. Another ingredient, the fish oil is made in Thailand. The fish used has to be caught in the country of Thailand to get the distinct fish that is used there. Different countries make fish oil with their own type of fish causing the taste to vary. The fish go through a fragmenting process and the juices are pressed out of it after a few weeks. All the ingredients used by Mint Thai are from the native country of Thailand and are added to the dish in the proper order to make the perfect dish. \n Another thing that Mint Thai does precisely is the way that they use the ingredients that they buy in their red curry.  The order that is used when adding ingredients is critical. For example, contrary to making vegetable stew, where you can add all your ingredients at the same time and throw it in the crock pot or on the stove, and come back to it at a later time, Thai Red Curry must be constantly watched over and made in a particular order. Straying from this order will cause the red curry to not be authentic and taste differently. \n So far, I've spoken of things that are important in order to get the taste of the red curry that you are looking for. Now I want to tough on how Mint Thai adds its own personal touch in order to make your experience while dinning and eating red curry feel authentic. The red curry is presented in such a way as you would find in Thailand. The food is always the right temperature and served with white rice. The staffs at Mint Thai are mostly all from the native country of Thailand. Hearing them speak to each other in the Thai language completes the experience. The decorations inside the restaurant are also very traditional Thai. It is complete with a picture of the King and Queen of Thailand, who are very highly respected and loved in Thailand.  \n Mint Thai gives dinning out for red curry the complete authentic experience. They are friendly and welcoming and the food is also fresh and delicious! The price is very reasonable and eating red curry there is one purchased meal you will not regret.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RFeDe3fNr14kvUKlVx6_4w"}

Or, ask the price in advance. Secondly, when I booked I was not aware that this restaurant is participating in the Restaurant.com program, therefore I had no idea that the owners are already ahead of the curve and most likely anticipating a certificate from first time patrons, particularly patrons who are not ethnically Chinese.\n\nThe restaurant was selected based on my experiences dining with a friend from Hong Kong, who was not with me last night. I found them on the website for the Chinese Cultural Center, as I have only lived here in AZ for two years. I didn't find out about the Restaurant.com certificate participation until after booking the reservation and then coming to Yelp to read reviews.  I happened to have over two hundred dollars in Restaurant.com certificates so I redeemed one to use for dinner. A happy accident, right?\n\nI've eaten in Chinatown in NYC many times, eaten in restaurants where there is no menu in English and my Cantonese speaking friend ordered, and have ordered a whole duck many times. Sometimes the side dishes or presentation vary a little, but there is no disputing the sum parts of an entire duck- it includes two wings and two legs. I know my duck.\n\nSo a duck, not on the menu but available, was ordered more than 24 hours in advance.  Upon arrival for our reservation the duck was served shortly thereafter with polite and congenial service from a woman I assume is one half of the couple that owns the restaurant. The Shanghai style crepes were good, the scallion was julienned, the hoisin sauce was augmented. It was delicious, but in my opinion it was not a whole duck as ordered and charged for- upon service I asked the woman if it was a whole duck because the sliced breast parts did not seem to be the entire bird. Also, in Chinatown there is a practice of presenting the duck,  carving at table, then whisking away to make a second course from the parts that don't easily lend themselves to rolling in crepes or in buns (some restaurants serve a puffy flat bun and not a crepe) but in our case there was no second course.\n\nWe ordered other dishes, especially since my dining companion is a neophyte to non-Americanized chinese.   We weren't there trying to get away with only fulfilling the required 45 dollar purchase per the gift certificate- I try to make it worth the owner's while and be fair. \n\nFor him there was peppersteak and house special fried rice, for me the sea bass in white wine (I wanted fish with pine nuts but they were out of nuts) and chinese fried cabbage, a stir fried bok choy and napa mixture with dried baby shrimp as seasoning.  The food was tasty, albeit too much salt was added, and I definitely tasted MSG in the fish and cabbage. Also, the beef and cabbage were swimming in a puddle of grease.  The cabbage alone was eight bucks, but again since we were getting a discount I thought it only fair to order at least one dish where the owner had a high markup. Ditto for the rice.\n\nWhen the bill came I was a little surprised to see that the Duck alone was forty bucks, since we didn't get the whole duck.  I tendered my certificate without a word and the staff politely packed up our leftovers, which was most of our meal- that was deliberate.  The bill with tax was 88 bucks and change, and the terms of the certificate included a mandatory 18 percent tip before discount. I don't have a problem with that at all, I always tip on the face value of a meal, not the discount price.  What I don't like however is the habit of owners to assess the tax on the total of the bill prior to discount- I've used certificates at restaurants that used computerized systems and never been taxed on the full price. This restaurant uses hand written tickets that are written entirely in chinese except for the numbers. To add insult to injury, the owner assessed the mandatory tip on the entire amount including the tax.  I know that waitstaff today assume that they are due a tip on the tax, but actually that's quite incorrect traditionally.  When the bill came back it was just shy of eighty dollars after discount.   I don't begrudge restaurant owners trying to keep afloat and make a living, but I don't like it when they pad the bill, and this bill was padded.  That plus our less than a whole duck left a bad taste in my mouth about this restaurant, and that alone is grounds for me not to return.  \n\nIf you want something better than american style chinese or want to use one of those certificates, then go ahead and dine at Lao Ching Hing, but this is my advice:  Only order off the menu.  Advise the server to ask the kitchen to go easy on the salt, and if you're not a fan of MSG, request that they keep it out of your food. Lastly, just order what you want for the meal and if you want extra, order it separately as take-out to avoid having a padded bill.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2unQHR9uaRxk3dsW6f3MGA"}

It has a lot of baseball decor on the walls instead of the typical Fridays bric-a-brac and large TVs to watch games on. Plus, it has large windows that let you see into the park.

Screw Dunkin' Donuts!!! \nI used to live in Glendale for a while and because a lot of downtown Glendale is made up of lots of Chicano/Mexican families pan dulce (sweet bread) from this place is all everyone ever has at parties, birthdays, Saturday morning breakfast, etc. I am certain they are family owned and have been in Glendale for many, many years. Usually they have 3 women running the front counter so do not be alarmed by the line. They try to get people in and out as soon as possible. They are very helpful if you do not know the names, most are in Spanish and they will assist you with names if you ask. \nMy favorite is the chilindrina (chee-lean-dree-na) it's round with yellow and chunks of sugar on top. You can't go wrong with the conchas (the bread that looks like shells, in a variety of color) or the cochinitos (the little gingerbread pigs). Ranch Market, Food City, whomever the hell, has NOTHING on this place!!!! The one thing you will notice is how soft this bread is and how it melts like butter when you bite into it. Lots of other Mexican markets offer tasteless, on the verge of being stale, hard bread (as much as I love you, yes, this means you Ranch Market). Nobody likes a bread where all the yummy little sugar pieces fall to the floor when you bite into it:( Also, the next day lots of breads are even tougher. Not this bread, it stays soft for a days, if it even makes it to a few days. \nThe red chili burritos are little, but orgasmic. Perhaps a few breads, a burrito and if you can somehow get your hands on a bottled Mexican Coke, it's time to get down to business, so unzip your pants and do it where people can't watch you, oh yeah... \nAlso,I don't believe they tell you, but if you get your bread in a box they will charge for the box.

The 360 degree view of the valley and Camelback Mountain on the roof was perfect for an Arizona wedding. Our reception was right downstairs. The wedding dinner prepared was lobster and seafood pasta and prime rib, and it was by far the best food served at a wedding that I've ever had. We had open bar at the wedding and the drinks were not watered down and well prepared. The rooms are a little too contemporary for my taste, but the suite we stayed in was cool. \n\nAside from our wedding, I'll add a couple of notes. The pool is some good fun and was filled with pretty folks. Cafe ZuZu in the hotel is okay, but not worth the price. If you are coming from out of town and you are young and heading to the Scottsdale clubs this is a premier place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6Kon3cR5ZEm5rmYKlpcfcw"}

After being seated for over 20 minutes and not one waiter coming by to take our tea order, my mom had to chase on down near the back of the restaurant.\n\nThe tea was too strong but most of the food was good. The haw gow (steamed shrimp dumplings), spare ribs with black bean sauce, jook (rice porridge), nor mi gai (ti leaf wrapped rice with chicken), and taro crisps were all good. The disappoints came from the sweet sesame balls and don tot (egg custard tarts) which we had to chase down a waiter again to procure.\n\nOverall, I'd say give this place a try but perhaps during the week to avoid this chaos.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0db71MbrvcJnyk71COCJBg"}

I was super bummed :( So I pulled out my Yelp iPhone app and searched for the closest Mexican place with a decent rating. I pulled up to a super sketchy shopping center and parked in front of a taco stand. I looked at the sign and realized it wasn't Rosa's, so I moved my car closer to the front of Rosa's. I walked in and the place is decorated pretty nicely. Chips and salsa came right away with my drink order. The chips were great: large, warm and crispy. The red salsa, however, left much to be desired. It was ok, but nothing to write home about. The green salsa, was absolutely gross! It was sweet. Sickly sweet. Call me crazy, but I was under the impression that salsa was supposed to be spicy. The sweetness of the green salsa only served to highlight how little spice was in the red salsa. But it was free, included in the meal, so I can't complain too much. I ordered a shredded beef crispy taco plate with rice and beans. Now, I don't eat a lot so the portion size was fine for me, but $8.50 for ONE taco and rice and beans? I think they should give you at least two. But, I suppose that is just the nature of ordering from a sit-down Mexican restaurant as opposed to a taco stand. Anyway, my entree came out quickly and although the menu only states soft taco, they gladly made me a crispy one. It's funny because the entire time I was sitting there munching on my chips, waiting for my taco, I kept thinking that I should have just gone over to the taco stand I initially pulled up to in the same shopping center. I wondered what their tacos were like. As soon as my food came and I took a bite of the taco, those thoughts immediately vanished. The shell was nice and crispy, shoved full of very flavorful shredded beef, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese. I like a litte spice to mine so I added some Cholula and it was right on the money. Onto the side dishes - here, they cancel each other out in my book. To give them credit, I usually do not like spanish/Mexican rice. I never eat it. In fact, I usually order double beans no rice. Their rice, however, was really quite good. It was super moist and flavorful, not dry or rubbery at all. I was really quite surprised at how good the rice was. The beans were also surprising, but not in a good way. They tasted more like bbq beans cooked next to, or in, a smoker. All I could taste was smoke and it was not only overwhelming, but out of place. Refried beans should not taste like pure smoke, just sayin'. All in all, the place was quite good. Service was friendly and attentive. However, I wouldn't drive 20  minutes out of the way to come here, like I would for Mango's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OVFcGSh4Wu-ss8Iq_fIC-Q"}

The ambiance has been taken down a notch since it was Hammerheads. Pool tables and arcade machines, and pool toys hanging from ceiling in the dining area - yikes. There was one kid playing a shoot-em-up game and another playing with the pool balls. Soft Italian music over the audio would have been much better than listening to the kids play, and the racket of the drunks coming in from the adjacent bar.\n\nWe showed up around 5:30 on a Friday night and there was only one other table being served in the dining area despite the parking lot being full (everyone was in the lounge). There was only one waitress working the dining area, and she was also working in the lounge. She was trying hard, but it was only her second day on the job. Both her and the bus-boy were dressed as though they were working in a dive sports bar, not a nice restaurant. Kind of a turn-off. She told us all the food and drink items on the menu were $2 off for happy hour, but that was not the case when we received our bill. Turned out only bar food was $2 off. (we still got happy hour priced drinks, though)\n\nAs an appetizer we ordered Calamari, and I gotta tell you, it was fantastic! Large chunks of tender squid in a very light, flaky batter, served with a nice boat of thick marinara sauce. Best calamari we ever had, for sure. Just wish it was a more ample portion.\n\nMy husband (it was our anniversary, BTW) ordered veal scallopine sauteed in a lemon sauce with artichoke hearts, mushrooms and capers. He loved it, although according to him, you really have to love lemon. I tried both a bit of the veal, which I thought tasted a bit \"gamey\" (guess I'm not a veal person) and the sauce, which I didn't care for at all. I will definitely not ever order that dish.\n\nI ordered the Linguine Portofino, which was huge butterflied shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops (or should I say scallop, since I only found one in the whole dish) and squid in a rich tomato sauce served over linguini. I think the noodles (a generous helping)  were home-made and they were delicious, as was the sauce.  Both our dishes were served piping hot.\n\nCloser to 7:00 pm the dining room filled up more, and my husband and I definitely felt over-dressed compared to the other patrons and wait staff, who were all dressed as if they were in a sports bar.\n\nAlthough our food was very good, the people at one table kept returning their food items (maybe it was because they couldn't stand to eat it after one of the millions of black flies that were milling about the dining room landed on their food). Portofino definitely needs to do something about the flies, which made the atmosphere even less enjoyable.\n\nI'll give the authentic food a 4, the service a 3, value a 3.5 and the ambiance a 2. I'll go back, but probably to check out the bar entertainment and not for a nice special occasion dinner.", "type": "review", "business_id": "aV4g1yMKv75FZGWs4a_2Bw"}

But customer service will kill a great food experience as has happened for me at Atlas Bistro.  Made a reservation for 12 during restaurant week, confirmed the day before.  When we arrived a table for 8 was set up and the remaining 4 of us had to wait nearly an hour to be added to the rest of our group.  We'd purchased wine next door at AZ Wine so started with that yet were offered no bread or snacks while we waited, much less an apology that our party was separated like this for nearly an hour of a confirmed reservation time.  Totally awkward for the 8 diners inside waiting to order/eat and the 4 of us outside the door waiting to get in.\n\nWe were seated in a tight center table with one end being near the kitchen door and the owner, then the manager got in to an altercation with one member of our group causing the entire restaurant to witness this \"scene' involving yelling and physical pushing.   The owner physically pushed his chair out of the way while he was sitting in it claiming in an angry tone that this diner had \"been in the way all night\".  I sat right across from this man and never saw him move his chair out of it's assigned spot (way too close to the kitchen door but where the restaurant located it) until the very end of the evening, after the check had been paid and most diners vacated the restaurant.  He had moved his chair to the end of the table to pose for a photo. \n\nAfter he was ejected from the restaurant, everyone in our group was humiliated, asked not to come back due to this altercation regarding one member at our table even though everyone else remaining had no idea what had even occured, much less been involved in it.  \"Unfortunately his behavior reflects on all of you and you are not welcome to come back here again\" we were told.  We were treated like lesser human beings I suppose because we had the audacity to come in during Restaurant Week and pay a reduced amount.  Clearly the restaurant was not equipped to handle a group that large, was burnt out after a week of Restaurant Week diners and took it out on the entire group.  They should have been embarassed at their own behavior publicly like that.\n\nLittle did they know this group was a small representation of a 1000+ member group, The Arizona Winebats, which just won Phoenix New Times \"Best of Phoenix\" award for their wine social group.  And they burned every member of this group with this behavior tonite.  And every member's family /friends.  Not very smart in this economic climate.  No good food (which it was/is good food there) will make up for that kind of poor customer service.\n\nAlso as a side note, a restaurant never knows when they are serving to a person who is personal friends with a big restaurant critic in town and who goes dining at various restaurants with said friend/critic while she is doing reviews.  That would be the case with this incident.\n\nI'll take my dollars to Total Wines and tried and true like Barrio Cafe and Digestif or NOCA,  thank you.

On the good side, they offer have slightly bland but passable interpretations of Mexican-inspired fast food. Little miniature tacos for a dollar is a fine deal, allowing you to sample a fine variety of meats in your meal, especially important since pastor is offered. And there's a little salsa bar too, which is a huge bonus for capsaicin junkies, as there's nothing worse than having to plead for an extra couple cups of sauce from stingy taco makers. Can metered doses of hot sauce really be cutting into profit margins? Maybe if the cups were a little bigger, I wouldn't need five of them. Anyhow, with salsa bar, go to town. Get reckless. \n\nIt's not all smiles around here, however. The glory of a taco shop lies partially in its propensity to serve up your grub lickity split, but Super Burrito does not subscribe to this philosophy at all. Super Burrito took an astoundingly, amazingly long time. There was only one other customer in the restaurant too, which compounded our confusion. I felt forgotten and unloved, and if I had known about the wait, I would have brought a copy of Atlas Shrugged. Nonetheless, the food does the trick and its available around the clock, meaning you could do worse than Super Burrito.", "type": "review", "business_id": "f_2iPdAHrcKMwMFJSRdFZQ"}

(see previous review for story thus far)\n\nLord knows what language the customer service line guy spoke, but it wasn't English. I fired up my laptop and met him online to get another flight. He said that the best he could do is to put me on a 5:45 am flight to Phoenix, and then a 10:00 am flight to Seattle. Why on earth would I want to fly to Phoenix? He told me that was the best he could do, as there were no direct flights. \"You see, this airline doesn't actually fly to Seattle,\" he informed me.\n\nLooking at ticket on hand, I could only assume one of us was losing it.\n\nOnline, my flight to Seattle disappeared, replaced by a flight to Salt Lake City. \"That should do it,\" he said. \n\n\"Seattle isn't in Utah,\" I spurted.\n\n\"Oh, yeah...\" he said, and then put me on hold again. I prayed he meant, \"Oh, yeah - I forgot Seattle because we're so busy with all these complications due to weather,\" and not \"Oh, yeah, Seattle is the capital of Tanzania.\"\n\nIt was 1:00 am. I was sleeping at home, at least for a couple of hours.\n\nAt oh-dark-thirty, I was sailing again through LAS TSA (love those guys!), I had no further issues with the new flight, other than that I was going in the opposite direction of my destination. Oh, and the seats are really tiny. But, we knew that.\n\nAfter my layover in Phoenix, my cute little pink polka-dot carryon and I tried to board the flight that would finally get us to Seattle. The nice lady at the gate told me that I'd have to check my bag - the carry-on bag that I meticulously packed with three weeks' worth of clothing and necessities so that I would NOT have to check anything or pay their insane $50 fee. The one that flew this far with me, no problem. I asked why.\n\n\"Because the plane is too full for your bag, ma'am,\" she said as she wrestled it out of my hands. When I almost burst into tears, she told me that she'd wave the $50 fee. This time.\n\nGee, thanks.\n\nI had to abandon my cute little bag with absolutely everything I would need for my trip at the end of the hallway, and hope like crazy that I'd see it again.\n\nNow, I was the very last person on the plane. The overhead bins were still open, and what did I see? I could have stored my bag and every last bag of the traveling Seattle Seahawks in the spaces left. There was plenty of room for my bag!\n\nMy entire row was empty. I had no seatmates for the whole flight.\n\nNeither did the guy behind me.\n\nOr the lady across from me.\n\nFull, huh? Or, full as in, \"We want another $50 and there's nothing you can do about it.\"\n\nUnbelievable. \n\nThe flight attendants were polite, and the rest of the flight uneventful. I was just amazed at what I had to go through to get that far.\n\nThe good news is that my cute little pink bag was, in fact, returned to me in one piece. The bad news is that the one piece is stained with giant black streaks and smells of jet fuel and sweat.\n\nNever again.

I would not go anywhere else in AZ  for plants, period.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cnLnPDP2NZh9KKTFFlaWSQ"}

First, the cornbread is a fun idea and is a nice change to free appetizers- but it was super thick and lacked any real cornbread flavor or consistency. The Catfish Tacos were a whole lot of cabbage and not much else... i literally could not taste the meat flavor hidden under the amount of cabbage stuffed in. And sadly, the Baked Seafood Enchiladas were another miss- it appeared to be two tortillas covered in sauce and rice with two shrimp inside... i couldn't taste much else and felt i could have taken a better stab at making this meal at home myself =/ (See my pictures to get a better idea)\n\nOn top of this, the service was a bit lackluster. There seemed to be a waiter and waitress simultaneously serving us- one taking the order, one getting our drinks, the other bringing out our food, the other with our check-  As confusing as this was, it was difficult for me to get my water refilled and had to flag down the waiters 2-3 times to get their attention.\n\nI'd like to add that during my stay in Phoenix i saw the hottest girls of my entire vacation at Z'Tejas(which was a plus, lol) But seriously, If you're cruising the mall and looking for a quick bite to eat- it wouldn't be a bad idea to check out Z'Tejas, just don't expect to much... i'm sure this place does it's drinks much better =)", "type": "review", "business_id": "duHUQFn7K-Ybs1rPI4AOEQ"}

El Chorro Lodge is a family favorite.

The patios have been enlarged to take advantage of the great views of Camelback Mountain, numerous fireplaces added to add to the ambiance and the charm of El Chorro preserved in the process. Kudos to the designers for saving the copper hood of the fireplace in the old dining room and relocating it to the renovated schoolroom bar! (One sad note, miss the \"Knights of the Round Table\" table that was next to old fireplace on the old main patio. Its now a service area, but time marches on!) \n\nThe entire of the new restaurant speaks of old Arizona, but in a fresh and modern way. Photos and art work of happy times at the Old El Chorro decorate the walls and is a gracious nod to the past. \n\nThe cocktail menu has been expand, and a second bar has been added with great views of Camelback Mountain. This is a terrific place to grab an old school martini or try one of their handcrafted cocktails. \n\nOur dinner was graced with the old relish tray, served on a cold plate instead of chipped ice. (Chipped ice would have been a nicer presentation.) \n\nAppetizers include the standard shrimp cocktail, flash fried lobster tail and new additions. Soup of the day or salad is included with the dinner entree, which is a nice touch in an ala carte world. \n\nMy girlfriend enjoyed the filet, which was tender and cooked to perfection. I enjoyed the duck breast, which was flavorful, tender and not overcooked. \n\nJust two notes for improvements, I don't know what happened to the original recipes for the flash-fried lobster batter or the sticky buns, but please, please look for them! Some classic items just do not need improvement! Also, $5 for valet parking, please.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cdwHgELA2puX2DNfwSt5EA"}

I was happy to see that there was actually a good amount of people in the restaurant, something that was hard to know from the street view. \n\nA big fan of salads, I ordered the Grilled House Chicken Salad (I believe the name is correct, might be house grilled chicken salad) and my friend the Fish and Chips. \n\nWhen the food came out I thought there was an error because there were two scoops of chicken salad, on my salad, where I was really looking for grilled chicken (not a big fan of mayo). What I realized is that I actually had ordered a chicken salad salad, that might contain grilled chicken. As far as how the menu was written I was convinced I was getting grilled chicken. \n\nTo the staff's credit, they swapped out the order right away with my next options, a grilled chicken caesar salad, however, it was too fast and I soon realized why. The salad was no more than bagged lettuce and precooked/grilled chicken thrown on top (with croutons, dressing, and grated parmesan cheese tossed on). Not how I want to spend $9. \n\nMaybe it was my fault for trying the salads, but today they were certainly 0/2.\n\nAs far as the fish and chips went, I didn't have the fish, but the fries were pretty good. \n\nI'll certainly try them again when I'm not in a salad or lunch mode, but with as times as tough as they are on Mill every detail matters!", "type": "review", "business_id": "F2Fxp4mQKOqSOYFEAOHnsw"}

I'm from LA so finding good Mexican food in Arizona that suits the style I'm used to has been pretty disappointing. For a metro area that has so many Mexican restaurants it's pretty pathetic that there is only one I really like. And that of course, is Mango's. The chips and salsa are so delicious! It's seriously the best salsa I've had in AZ. And it's FREE - included in your meal like chips and salsa should be! I hate going to places where I end up paying extra for chips and salsa and they give me some nasty red sauce with seeds in it. That shit is all over AZ, seriously what gives? Anyway, I am obsessed with shredded beef crispy tacos and this place has really good ones. I used to work in Mesa so it was close by for a lunch break but I no longer work there so I haven't been back in a couple months. I drove 20 minutes out of my way yesterday to get me a shredded beef taco from Mango's and I get there and they were freaking closed! Apparently they close at 4 on Monday's (and I believe 7 the rest of the week, closed Sunday). I was super bummed :( I ended up going a few blocks up to Rosa's and the taco was good but their salsa was very meh. \nA short rebuttal to the negative reviews given:\nI would seriously question the reliability of reviews given by people who ordered quesadillas and burritos. To begin with, I think there is always something wrong with a person who goes to a Mexican restaurant and orders a quesadilla. Unless you're under 12, grow up and order some big boy food. Any asshole can make a quesadilla or a burrito. If you are going to review a Mexican restaurant I think it should be on the entrees that actually require some skill: enchiladas, tamales, tacos, etc. And in that regard, Mango's does an excellent job. It is a tad expensive for what you get, but I will gladly continue to pay a little extra for the on-point flavors. \nAlso, if anyone has any recommendations for great crispy shredded beef tacos closer to N. Tempe/S. Scottsdale I'm all ears!", "type": "review", "business_id": "FFHzFdyWgM-OdMghuXMPEQ"}

More of a disappointment and a bummer.\n\nIn a nutshell- apathetic General Manager acting as expeditor sent out food that should not have gone out to clients. He should have looked at it first- nothing major, a baked potato cut down the middle with a large black \"tumor\" of rot hidden beneath the skin at one end. Could happen to anyone at home, I didn't want a free meal, but I thought that as expeditor he should be more alert.  His response was no response until he waited on me at the register, where his comeback to the issue was \"it was an eye.\"  No, it was not a potato eye- they are external root sprouts and not black- and even so, what restaurant serves potatoes without trimming eyes?  He proceeded to grow increasingly more condescending, apathetic, and overtly rude albeit being rude using \"kind\" words- the dismissive \"thanks for coming and you have a nice day\" said in a tone of voice that essentially translates to \"F off.\"  He just would not take ownership for the oversight, and obviously is not a person to learn from his mistakes. He's in the wrong business.  I have had salads served to me with the huge copper staples from the lettuce crate in my salad and expected nothing but for the prep cook in the pantry to use more diligence when washing and chopping lettuce. I didn't even want an apology, just a simple acknowledgment that there was an oversight that needed to be more closely heeded before sending food out from the line. All I got was attitude from a young man whose age I double, but who believes that he knows much more than I do and whose authority is not to be challenged. \n\nMy server Emmy was great, she got a 30% tip from me. That manager netted a phone call to Cracker Barrel customer service.

This was one of my favorite places to visit, to introduce newcomers to, treat family and friends, and for a time I'd visit once every two months or so. My previous three visits have not gone so well; I'll relate my latest visit which took place just over a week ago. A friend attempted to make reservations for two on a Thursday. He was told that due to a policy change by  Richardson, a reservation for two on a Thursday could no longer be taken, as there was disappointment that their business for tables of 4 or more were suffering. Okay, I can understand, business decisions have to be made, but cut your nose off to spite your face? However, the woman that answered the phone let us know there should be no problem getting a table. I was seated shortly before my friend arrived so I had a chance to look over the menu. To my surprise, some changes have been made. First, a salad choice (and they're all very typically very yummy), anyway, a choice is no longer offered. Instead, the house salad is offered at $4 with the entree purchase. Next, a statement is now printed across the top of the menu letting the patron know \"you order it, you bought it\"...is this REALLY necessary? While the server and busboy were friendly and helpful (my water glass was never empty), my $4 house salad arrived about 90 seconds before our entrees did. Oh, the accompanying bread was hard as stone and arrived with my salad, while an attentive server should have brought it along just after our drinks were served, as my dinner partner hadn't ordered a salad. Oh, my friend, he's typically a big fan of the Steak Rokerij, and absolutely loves the crab/hollandaise sauce mixture. As normal, he asked for more sauce. On this visit, we found $10 added to the check for that request. We found that unusual for Rokerij. Things have certainly changed. I was willing to overlook these changes, after all, the economy is poor these days. I excused myself to use the men's room. After all, we did have Chimay (Rokerij has never had a wide beer selection). I found the towel basket to be so PACKED with paper-towels, I couldn't get one out of the basket, which is on a vanity so small, when you turn the water on, the towels become soaked. This explains the stained, linen towel basket liner...the stains were grays and greens. Overall, I feel that these things add up to failing to pay attention to detail. It's a shame really. I really hope the best for Richardson and hope Rokerij can return to it's former self.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg"}

Being vertically challenged, I was pleased that the booth bench was high in relation to the table level, but it certainly could have had a lot more cushion.  \n\nWe were brought drinks, had orders took, and tortilla chips brought promptly. I really liked the chips. They were paper thin, very crispy, and were glistening with fresh, hot, fryer oil. The pico de gallo type salsa also tasted very fresh and home-made, but it could have done better with a few less chopped onion chunks in it. Upon request, we were also brought a bowl of more picante salsa, which had the flavor of roasted red chilies. Nice.\n\nOur orders, both from the lunch menu, were also served quite quickly.  My husband had a cheese enchilada/chicken taco combo (~$6.25) which came with black beans (on request), rice, and a cabbage garnish. I didn't even see the taco since my husband devoured it so fast, but his enchilada was swimming in a mixture of cheese & red sauce which he said was pretty tasty. \n\nI had a chicken enchilada (~$6.75). There were nice chunks of breast in there that actually tasted like chicken, unlike some other mexican joints where the meats all have the same texture & flavor. The enchilada was drizzled with a nice green chili sauce. The spanish rice was a little bit nondescript, but was more edible than some other restaurants'.  Mine was also served with black beans as requested, and a cabbage garnish. There were also more big chunks of onion in the garnish. I'm not an onion hater, don't get me wrong, but I'm sure after this feast, nobody would want to be within four feet of me. If I was on lunch break from one of the nearby offices, I'd probably request they go easy on the onions, lest I offend my work-mates back at the office.\n\nAlthough I arrived with a huge appetite, I was stuffed after devouring everything on my plate.

I'm not talking about seafood that is done as a form of art such as Eric Ripert executes at Le Bernardin- I'm talking minimal preparation with little more than lemon juice, butter and Old Bay seasoning.  The kind of food you get at the legendary Berkeley Seafood Market in South Seaside Park, or used to get at Spike's market in Point Pleasant before they changed hands and raised prices a decade ago.\n\nI've never been a fan of corporate restaurants, and derisively refer to Red Lobster as the Frog Lobster.  My first experience with Joe's was in Toledo, OH, when they opened up in 1996. Back then they had an overly unctious crab soup my ex was enamored of, and more raw bar offerings.\nOne thing that has been consistent however is the coconut shrimp, and that's why I go there. Unlike most chains and non chains alike that buy the coconut shrimp frozen and pre-breaded, Joe's breads their shrimp to order as fried shrimp should be breaded.  The other thing I order is the Beantown Bake steampot, as it has two \"cricket\" lobsters as we call them back east plus some steamed littleneck clams just like an old time clambake.  I could care less about the sausage but it's edible, and the shrimp are okay too as are the seasoned potatoes and the half ear of corn. For the price though the lobster and clams shine- here in AZ a person can't go to the supermarket and buy two lobsters for the price that the steampot costs at Joe's ($38.50 less than four weeks ago.)\n\nI confess I don't bother to order any of the fish filets or other items at Joe's, but I will say that they get the straightforward items right- crisp fries, fresh coleslaw without too much vinegar, sugar, salt or mayo and balanced in flavor and I do like the chutney like dip for the coconut shrimp. My bf has been going to Florida for over 60 years and he likes the fried shrimp so it must be decent.  Maybe I'll go there the next time I get a yen for classic fish and chips, but living in Buckeye it's easier to just do that at home.\n\nSo, everything in life being relative, if you're looking for basic fresh seafood prepared simply, eat at Joe's.

My husband and I were thinking of going somewhere else, but then the co-worker said she is spoiled at El Rico's and does not find anywhere else as good. So I thought we should give it a try. My husband loves authentic Mexican food and considers himself a good judge at finding a worthy place, and unfortunately they did not pass the test. The ambience is nice on the outside, the inside is a little too cafeteria like, not quite restaurant style. I will give them credit for the ceiling, very dramatic d\u00e9cor (but that's not what I'm eating off of). The salsa was amazing, definitely my choice in dips. However the chips are way too thick, that's just a preference though. The food was not as strong tasting as we would like, my husband said it was like eating water but I think that's over exaggerating. I didn't mind the food too much, although I still left hungry (ordered the flauta plate). But, are you ready for the kicker? The taco my husband ordered still had the wire piece in it that holds it together during frying. Cooking 101 do not leave metal shards in food.\nWait a second, I just looked up their website and they have the inside all decorated. Don't let that fool you. When we went the tables were bare and sticky. I was going to give them 2 stars but just decided on 1 for the false advertising. Fine dining experience my butt. We went early so it was not crowded and  yet service was still slow, although polite.", "type": "review", "business_id": "i1GWM0MKxF3V5jveyCks7A"}

They argue with you that the incorrectly made bagel is correct.  They make you wait longer for the new one.  They do not even offer the common courtesy of a simple apology for wasting your time.  That was my first experience.  The second experience, I asked for my bagel to be toasted twice.  I saw the girl toast it once.  When I asked whether she toasted it twice, she yelled the toaster is broken-I can't toast it twice.  What?  Why is it my problem the toaster is broken?  And she had not toasted it twice.  The gentleman in front of me advised me to leave if I had not already paid because he had been waiting 20 minutes for 3 bagels.  These people should not be working with the public and even worse, probably could not answer - what is 2+2.

Now i'm not positive, but I'm pretty sure Mcdonalds has a company policy where large orders that take this amount of time are required to \"pull around\" and wait to have their food brought to them, to allow small orders, like my Large Diet Coke which takes 13 seconds to fill, \"fast food\" service.

Manger yells at the employee, explains proper procedure (which is another time consuming task), all the while i'm sitting here and I just want my fucking Diet Coke and card refunded.

The fact that he reviewed three pizza places in one day, and then reviewed two others on the same day 34 days later seems fishy to me- who orders pizza from two or three places in the same day or even the same week? Anyway,  Believe me, if you've read my review of Landini's Pizza in San Diego, then you understand that \"I know from pizza\" as the saying goes in  NY.  \n\nPizza is one of the trinity foods of the greater NYC area, the other two being bagels and authentic deli.  All three are frequently imitated but seldom duplicated accurately outside of a 50 mile radius of Manhattan.\n\nI moved to AZ for a variety of reasons, and specifically to Buckeye in order to be in proximity to family plus for a great deal on a house.  Why else would I subject myself to the hinterlands of Maricopa County, the epicenter of AZ?  Never in my wildest dreams would I imagine that in a sleepy town best known for farms and rodeo (as well as the only way to LA prior to the completion of I-10) a pizza man from NYC would decide to relocate his family and business. The owner, who is ethnically half Italian and half Albanian (a country across the narrow Adriatic from Italy) cut his dough tossing chops in NY for over twenty years and it shows as soon as you walk in the door- the old school style menu over the counter using plastic letters to detail the numerous subs, dinners, and even Sicilian style pies are a throwback to every neighborhood pizza joint I've ever patronized in my fifty plus years.  There are no conveyor belt ovens, no round pizza grates or pans, just pumice lined pizza ovens fired up over five hundred degrees. \n\nRelatives from NJ just departed after a family wedding; last Thursday one of them had a yen for pizza, a food I normally would not recommend they order away from home because the quality would be dicey at best. Not only could I recommend Argentos, but I encouraged them to order.  The Jerseyites were not disappointed, and in fact they proclaimed the pizza to be excellent and delicious.\nWhat better validation could a pizza shop get?", "type": "review", "business_id": "kbO05xSzzxn4LXfPLL5qvA"}

Of course, be sure to order all of your noodle dishes with the hand pulled noodle option.\n\nBack to the seafood with cream sauce dish: I am not a fan of cream sauces. I hate alfredo, bechamel, etc. but this cream sauce was the BEST medium to bring out the natural sweetness and full bodied flavor of the hand pulled noodles. This cream sauce did not have any cheese in it and the seafood wasn't the highest quality either (just ignore the seafood). Our young waiter recommended this dish as the best of the house and my mom decided to give it a shot. No one touched the dish until we ate all the other food and were forced to acknowledge its presence.  Overwhelmingly, this dish became our favorite. Luckily it was generously sized so everyone got enough.\n\nThe hand pulled noodles were thinner than I expected, about ramen width sized and I enjoyed watching the noodle man smack and twist them into my order.  Something I could never do and the packaged stuff just doesn't compare. If you really want to appreciate the flavor and texture of these noodles, I highly recommend trying out the seafood cream dish. \n\nOverall, this place is a bargain. Besides the above referenced dish, we had the oxtail noodle soup (not a lot of meat in it although the broth was delicious), stir fried noodles with XO sauce and a fried fish special.

With an extensive beer selection and full bar, with relatively competent bartenders that seemed to be able to keep up with the demand for drinks and extended hours, this seemed like a great place for a late night snack and nightcap.\n\nThe following week, we return on a Wednesday, about 2 hours before closing time.  We sat at a booth in the bar area and were met by a server relatively quickly.  Our order was taken and drinks brought out, only to find out that they are only doing slices of pizza at the time, not making any new ones...We figured we'd try it out and get a couple of slices with some pretzles to even it all out.  After finishing our slices and waiting for an extra 10-15 minutes, we finally flagged down the waitress and asked about the pretzles, she mentioned that the kitchen wasn't cooking anything new.\n\nWe also asked one of the bartenders (who may or may not have been a manager), when they killed the menu for future reference, and was told about 10 or 10:30 they went to slices only of whatever they had available (in a rather rude tone for someone addressing two of maybe 8 customers in the whole place...).  After eliciting our disappointment, they offered to comp our drinks, which were the most expensive items we ordered, which made the visit managable but still very disappointing.\n\nBottom Line:  Go for lunch, when it won't be too busy, and you'll have a chance at being treated properly.

The other  was some sort of chicken dish ordered extra spicy, and he was a bit surprised (but not disappointed) it had *very* hot sliced hot peppers in it. I ordered off the regular menu, Phat Thai (pad thai) for $8.95 ordered extra \"Thai\" spicy, which was served with soup and it was delicious. There were several pieces of tender chicken but only two large shrimp in the noodle dish, which was probably enough to split in half and take home, but I didn't because it was too tasty. \n\nAll in all the food and service were very good, the only reason for only four stars was it just didn't go that extra mile in ambiance, price, etc. that makes someone rave about a new favorite to recommend driving across the state for.

I had to take half of it back to our hotel to finish it the next day. Her sandwich was really good too. It was also too big for her, and we had to bring it back to the hotel to happily devour the next day. Damn you Carly's for stopping us from checking out one of the other great little restaurants in Phoenix for lunch the next day due to your very good too-large-for-one sandwiches.\n\nThe service was slightly lacking. This was due to the fact that our cool Aussie server was, we think, the only one working that night. I can't fault him on the slower than hoped for service due to that fact, but it would have been great if they had another person on staff to help alleviate that problem.\n\nOur only real complaint was the music that was being performed. We walked in happy and upbeat, but wanted to shoot ourselves in the face half way through our visit due to the sad and depressing music being performed. The lady singing had a great voice, and the guitar-playing man played his instrument well, but the music was really really really depressing. It was all of our family and friends had just died depressing. It was both of us had just lost our jobs and home depressing. It was really really really really depressing. Walking by other nights, we had noticed music that wasn't depressing at all being played by different performers though, so maybe we just hit the place on a bad night. \n\nOverall, it was cool decor, great food, decent service all things considered, and sad sad sad music on the night we were there.

I was recommended to come here by someone, can't remember. When I do I'll make sure to punch them in the gut. My friend who is from Mexico and handles spicy like no big deal, ordered a spicy seafood soup. Within no time at all it looked as if he was bawling into his sulfur concoction. Between the spice and the temp of the soup, it was too much. Even just the steam from the food getting into his eyes seemed to be driving him mad. He was trying to take it like a man, but once someones nose starts to let go, uh yeah, WAITRESS! I call her over and try to explain the situation. She gives me a slight, polite smile and walks away with the sopa de sulfur. Brings back the soup this time not so red, like they quickly ran it under the sink to dilute the spice. Still my friend found it too spicy, and I call her over again. She says nothing, with the same smile goes into the kitchen and now yelling is coming from where she went into. At this point my friend is pretty uncomfortable and we ask a random worker if we can just order another dish. Some lady about 3 feet tall with a biker attitude comes out and starts yelling at me for returning her dish. It's like nobody understood from the beginning that it was too spicy and hot. I got more of an idea that maybe they thought we didn't like the food. She then had the audacity to tell me that whatever I ordered next I would have to pay for as well. OH NO SHE  DI' INT!!!

My friends came to pick me up at the airport, drive 1,000 MPH to US Egg so we could get our protein cake fix in, and then they whooshed us back to the airport.

Yeah yeah, sure, they go fine with a Santa Fe chicken sandwich.

Now replace the crappy white flour with some whole wheat flour so you're not unknowingly killing  yourself.  Now add a very generous scoop of fresh blueberries into the pancake batter.  And now add a significant quantity of almonds and granola.  And now add an unholy amount of cinnamon and spices.   Notice that it is bigger than your head; notice that you get two of them.  And then top it off with about 903 metric tons of butter and real maple syrup.  If you haven't found love right there on your plate, then dare I say you have a non-functional tongue.\n\nTry the hot skillets, too-- super-good.   \n\nBut everything they have there is really good.  Very fresh ingredients, lovingly prepared, good coffee (decent decaf, too!), and served by waitstaff who are in impossibly good shape (ever notice that?).\n\nThe owners are really great guys; they always make you feel welcome and appreciated, even when the line is long.\n\nSpeaking of lines, there is often a pretty big crowd on the weekends.

We had an 8pm reservation that we had made weeks in advance. The restaurant even called us that afternoon to confirm the reservation.  Our table was not ready when we arrived and we were all forced to cram into the entryway to wait.  There was no place at the bar or anywhere else for us to sit or even grab a glass of water while we waited.  At 830 we asked if we could get some appetizers and drinks while we waited.  They refused to do so.  They finally sat us at 9pm, an HOUR after our reservation.  What did they do to make up for it?  NOTHING!  We repeatedly asked the manager, waitress and hostess to bring appetizers to the table immediately on the house. They brought 3 small bowls of edamame and one glass of champagne for the bachelorette whose night they had ruined.  \n\nI am astounded that a restaurant would leave 20 guests waiting over an hour without offering them a beverage, appetizer or even an apology.  In fact, rather than trying to apologize or make it up to us with a free round of drinks, they claimed it was our fault because they did not take reservations.

Let me just start by saying what a beautiful restaurant.  Pretty decor accompanied by a pretty and attentive staff.  Started the night off with the Hummus and Taboule served with pita as an appetizer, it was me and two other guests so the waitress was nice enough to add two more pitas for each of us.  The hummus trio was DELICIOUS, spicy, pungent, and the taboule the perfect accoutrement.  The dish came out before we were even done with figuring out what we wanted for our entree.  Excellent service!  Not to mention the plate was hearty enough to feed a starving commune in Africa.\n\nI ordered the falafel pita and my guests had the Mediterranean chicken pita and the other had the Greek salad (she's not the one to take out to dinner) haha i was so mad i was like whatt??? you ordered the salad??  but i guess you could blame it on the waiter kind of rushing the order (it was sunday night at 8:00 with not much other people in the restaurant so i could see why he would want us out quick.)  Before we were even half finished with our hummus appetizer our entrees were on the table.  My falafel was a little crunchy and felt like it should have been more fresh, kind of made me wonder how it came out so quick, they probably had pre-made falafel on the side and just threw it in.  but i still love falafels and this had some serious spice and flavor, i couldn't complain.\n\nAfter reading reviews on here I told the waiter to order my guest the mango raspberry cheesecake and she was in love!!  The waiter brought out some boxes for our unfinished plates and we happily obliged.  He then brought some extra pitas wrapped up after i already paid for the bill which i thought was awesome!  I was checking out their happy hour specials and they looked very appealing, $1 to $3 Tapas with $3 imports after 9 sounded like a plan to me.

I find the flavors to be rich and the Wedding Cake just kills me. I think the best way I can describe the taste is beautiful.

Few things are better than a made-to-order, hand-breaded, fresh, fish sandwich. This catfish filet was NOT frozen. The cornmeal breading was very crunchy. Cooked perfectly. Light, flaky, NOT greasy at all. Just a perfect sandwich all around. Get this, the combo plate was only $6.50. Seriously? Awesome.\n\nWhen asked if I wanted hot sauce or mayo on the sandwich, I replied, \"both.\" BEST DECISION EVER! The hot sauce adds the necessary flavor to the mildly seasoned breading while the mayo provides the creaminess that a tartar sauce adds without the overwhelming tartar flavor. (Note: I'm not a big tartar sauce fan b/c it hides the flavor of the fish).\n\nSo, skip the fries. They're just frozen potatoes that don't taste like anything. I'm still giving Mandy's 5 stars, because the sandwich was truly exceptional. And honestly, didn't come for the fries. But ask them which sides are made on site. The onion rings and fried okra are probably good. \n\nPS-don't worry about it being catfish. It's seriously good.\nPPS-I grew up around a LOT of fish fries in Kentucky.

At this joint, they must have mercifully suggested to employees to just be friendly. Walking through the restaurant for a little pre-meal recon, nearly everyone we passed said hey or asked how it was going, so you felt surrounded by really nice folks instead of obnoxious corporate drones. Hell of a first impression. It's a good thing too, because there's a sign just inside the door boldly proclaiming that some website poll rated them best in town in about 11 different categories like \"pizza,\" \"Italian,\" \"worth the wait,\" and such, so the bar had been set pretty high.\n\nOne good question is why more popular restaurants don't have a spot where you can comfortably spend the half-hour that you wait for a table getting shellacked on a patio? Good move, Oregano's. Bartenders were omnipresent and eager to please. $12 for a pitcher of Kiltlifter is just, and under $5 for a glass of wine is approaching dangerous. \n\nPrepare for challenges upon being seated as the menu is just about as gargantuan as the portions (and the portions are colossal). Pizza is the signature, and you have some options. Who outside of Illinois knew that there is a Chicago-style thin crust pie? The bane of lousy pizzerias is the inability to make a fully cooked thin crust without turning it into a cracker, but these guys pulled it off. Plus Poblano peppers added some welcome zest. It didn't live up to an 11-category sweep, but it was pretty good pie. If you have any calzone fans in attendance, the O-zone is crafted from a rolled-up 18\" pie and it's pretty much otherworldly if you like stuffing pounds of cheese into your face. It's so thick that it takes 45 minutes to cook, but if you came to Oregano's, you probably weren't pressed for time to begin with, so whatever. We also dug into the Mexican-themed Pablo Picasso Salad which was literally enough food for three people. Normally, I could do without salad and especially one not shamelessly smothered in dressing, but this one actually has enough flavor on its own merits that it's not just a vessel for ranch. Capping off a totally gluttonous food orgy, the pizookie dessert was giant cookie half-baked in a little deep dish then covered in ice cream, which pretty much speaks for itself.\n\nAll in all, Oregano's served up a fine meal experience. The service was more or less astounding, portions are enormous, prices aren't out of control, and the place had a pretty cool layout and vibe. Though better than just passable, the pizza didn't knock my socks off, but maybe that's what you get for foregoing deep dish at a Chicago pizzeria. So I'd look elsewhere if you're in a rush or on a diet, but otherwise it's certainly a worthwhile place at which to gorge yourself.", "type": "review", "business_id": "o-OV2LkJxpcCHmI_d4TZiQ"}

I managed to convince my skeptical friend to try it one massively hungover morning. She ordered neither a waffle or chicken but after she saw the table next to us get their chicken, she added a drumstick to her order. I got the same thing I got last time, the Betty Boop which is one chicken breast and one waffle. Their chicken is absolutely delicious, truly top notch. The waffles are also good but I like a bit of a thicker waffle, as they make theirs quite thin so it loses its crunch rather quickly once you pour syrup on it. \nHere is my only real problem with place (and thus minus one star): they have serious timing issues when bringing out food. The extra piece of chicken my friend ordered was the first thing to arrive. A couple minutes later my plate arrived. A couple minutes after that, the rest of my friend's food arrived. That is really annoying and not a good way to run a restaurant. The food should all be brought out at the same time. Period. Other than that, the service is good but they appear to take a team-style approach to service whereby you will have 4 to 5 different people taking care of your table. My advice: focus - one server per table, and get a food runner so that I am not confused as to who my waiter is and my food comes out at the same time.

It's not so much a bar as an actual pub-- a cozy, comfortable establishment where you can also drink cheaply during soccer games, hear a song or two, or generally just get shitfaced. We happened to show up during Monday Night Football, and though the bartender and some patrons were vocally at odds with their rooting interests, everything was kept relatively civil throughout the evening. Though Irish-Americans aren't especially known for their cuisine, the easy-on-the-eyes waitress served up some of the finest corned beef boxty going. The meat was lean and tender, and the whole thing was complemented by a heaven-sent mustard-based sauce. It's a knockout. Eat it. There are plenty of whiskies too, if that's your thing, and if you're here, it may as well be your thing.\n\nAll in all, there's not much to complain about.

We were seated fairly quickly and the service was prompt and friendly.  The atmosphere is cafeteria-like with outdated decor.  However, the menu has all of the regular breakfast offerings and then some.\n\nI went with the Farmer's skillet and it was great.  My only complaint is that the potatoes were not crispy enough for my liking, but all in all, the flavors were good and it hit the spot.  Next time,  I think I will go with the Vatican, which got good reviews from one dining companion.  The only real negative was that the tortilla that came with the huevos rancheros was a little hard.  All in all, this is a good breakfast stop for the basics in a secluded strip mall behind the Home Depot.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2nzUx_M8Szyzsf4CszHasw"}

Yummy choices, even for our picky eaters.\n\nWe didn't get to use the pool because the weather wasn't cooperating, but even in the 40 degree temperatures we saw several other people enjoying the pool and the hot tub.  They must have been well heated.\n\nThe staff were all very helpful.  They accommodated our late check-out needs and our early housekeeping needs (so we could put the twins down for a nap).  And the free Wi-Fi was great to have.\n\nThe only drawback was the couch in our living room was really uncomfortable and had several stains on it.
